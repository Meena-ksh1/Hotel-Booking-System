A **Hotel Booking System** is a software application designed to simplify the process of managing hotel reservations. It allows users to check room availability, book rooms based on their preferences, and generate receipts for their stay. The system typically includes different types of rooms (such as Single, Double, or Deluxe), each with its own price. When a booking is made, the customer's name, contact details, and stay duration are recorded. The system then calculates the total bill and saves the booking information to a file for future reference. An admin panel is also included, which allows hotel staff to securely view all bookings made by customers. This project is built using core programming concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), arrays, file input/output (File I/O), and string handling, making it a functional and educational tool for managing hotel operations.

Concepts Used: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Arrays, File Handling, and String Manipulation.

This system makes hotel room management easier and more efficient for both users and administrators.
